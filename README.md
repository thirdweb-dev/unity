# Getting Started

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/releases) page and download the latest `.unitypackage` file.

Follow our [Getting Started Guide](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity/getting-started).

All you need is a [ThirdwebManager](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity/thirdwebmanager) prefab in your scene to interact with the SDK from anywhere!

Various blockchain interaction examples are available in our `Scene_Prefabs` scene.

Payment related interaction examples are available in our `Scene_Pay` scene.

**Notes:**
- The SDK has been tested on Web, Desktop and Mobile platforms using Unity 2021 and 2022 LTS. We **highly recommend** using 2022 LTS.
- The example scenes are built using Unity 2022 LTS, it may look off in previous versions of Unity.
- The Newtonsoft DLL is included as part of the Unity Package, feel free to deselect it if you already have it installed as a dependency to avoid conflicts.
- If using .NET Framework and encountering an error related to HttpUtility, create a file `csc.rsp` that includes `-r:System.Web.dll` and save it under `Assets`.
- If you have conflicting DLLs from other SDKs, in most cases our SDK will be compatible with previous versions, use version control and test removing duplicates.

# Usage

In order to access the SDK, you only need to have a [ThirdwebManager](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity/thirdwebmanager) in your scene.

```csharp
// Configure the connection
var connection = new WalletConnection(
  provider: WalletProvider.EmbeddedWallet, // The wallet provider you want to connect to (Required)
  chainId: 5,                              // The chain you want to connect to (Required)
  email: "email@email.com"                 // The email you want to authenticate with (Required for this provider)
);

// Connect the wallet
string address = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK.Wallet.Connect(connection);

// Interact with the wallet
CurrencyValue balance = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK.Wallet.GetBalance();
var signature = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK.Wallet.Sign("message to sign");

// Get an instance of a deployed contract (no ABI required!)
var contract = ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK.GetContract("0x...");

// Fetch data from any ERC20/721/1155 or Marketplace contract
CurrencyValue currencyValue = await contract.ERC20.TotalSupply();
NFT erc721NFT = await contract.ERC721.Get(tokenId);
List<NFT> erc1155NFTs = await contract.ERC1155.GetAll();
List<Listing> listings = await contract.Marketplace.DirectListings.GetAllListings();

// Execute transactions from the connected wallet
await contract.ERC20.Mint("1.2");
await contract.ERC721.Signature.Mint(signedPayload);
await contract.ERC1155.Claim(tokenId, quantity);
await contract.Marketplace.DirectListings.BuyListing(listingId, quantity);

// Custom interactions
var res = await contract.Read<string>("myReadFunction", arg1, arg2, ...);
var txRes = await contract.Write("myWriteFunction", arg1, arg2, ...);
```

# Build Instructions

## General

- Use `Smaller (faster) Builds` in the Build Settings (IL2CPP Code Generation in Unity 2022).
- Use IL2CPP over Mono when possible in the Player Settings.
- Using the SDK in the editor (pressing Play) is an accurate reflection of what you can expect to see on native platforms.
- In most cases, setting `Managed Stripping Level` to minimal when using IL2CPP is also helpful - you can find it under `Player Settings` > `Other Settings` > `Optimization`

## WebGL

- In order to communicate with the SDK on WebGL, you need to `Build and run` your project so it runs in a browser context.
- Open your `Build settings`, select `WebGL` as the target platform.
- Open `Player settings` > `Resolution and Presentation` and under `WebGLTemplate` choose `Thirdweb`.
- Save and click `Build and Run` to test out your game in a browser.

Important: If you're uploading your build, set `Compression Format` to `Disabled` in `Player Settings` > `Publishing Settings`.

Please note that Embedded Wallets (OAuth version) may not work when testing locally using Unity's default Build and Run feature for WebGL.

You must host the build or run it locally yourself after adding the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` header and setting it to `same-origin-allow-popups`.

Here's a simple way to do so, assuming you are in your WebGL build output folder:

```csharp
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 8000;

app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.header('Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy', 'same-origin-allow-popups');
  next();
});

app.use(express.static('.'));
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`));
```

Once again, please note that no action is needed for hosted builds.

## Mobile

- For Android, it is best to run Force Resolve from the `Assets` menu > `External Dependency Manager` > `Android Resolver` > `Force Resolve` before building your game.
- For iOS, if you are missing a MetaMask package, you can double click on `main.unitypackage` under `Assets\Thirdweb\Plugins\MetaMask\Installer\Packages` and reimport the `iOS` folder (only).
- ~~If you are having trouble building in XCode, make sure `ENABLE_BITCODE` is disabled and that the `Embedded Frameworks` in your `Build Phases` contain potentially missing frameworks like `MetaMask` or `Starscream`. You may also need to remove the `Thirdweb/Core/Plugins/MetaMask/Plugins/iOS/iphoneos/MetaMask_iOS.framework/Frameworks` folder in some cases.~~ Recent versions should no longer require this.

## Miscellaneous
If you don't want to use Minimal Stripping, you could instead create a `link.xml` file under your Assets folder and include assemblies that must be preserved, for instance:

# Prefab Examples

![image](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/assets/43042585/a213b668-0273-400f-a6c1-92a582a35535)

The `Examples` folder contains a demo scene `Scene_Prefabs` using our user-friendly prefabs - they include script examples to get inspired and are entirely **optional**. You do not need to use any of them to recreate their functionality. We recommend creating your own UI once you are familiar with the SDK.

All Prefabs require the [ThirdwebManager](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/blob/main/Assets/Thirdweb/Core/Scripts/ThirdwebManager.cs) prefab to get the SDK Instance, drag and drop it into your scene and select the networks you want to support from the Inspector.

[Connect Wallet](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/blob/main/Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Scripts/Prefabs/Prefab_ConnectWallet.cs) - All-in-one drag & drop wallet supporting multiple wallet providers, network switching, balance displaying and more!

- Drag and drop it into your scene.
- Set up the networks you want to support from the ThirdwebManager prefab.
- You can add listeners from the inspector for various wallet events.

[NFT Loader](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/blob/main/Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Scripts/Prefabs/Prefab_NFTLoader.cs) - Standalone drag & drop grid/scroll view of NFTs you ask it to display!

- Go to the prefab's Settings in the Inspector.
- Load specific NFTs with token ID.
- Load a specific range of NFTs.
- Load NFTs owned by a specific wallet.
- Or any combination of the above - they will all be displayed automatically in a grid view with vertical scroll!
- Customize the prefab's ScrollView and Content gameobjects if you want your content to behave differently.

[NFT](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/blob/main/Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Scripts/Prefabs/Prefab_NFT.cs) - Displays an NFT by calling LoadNFT through script!

- Instantiate this Prefab through script.
- Get its Prefab_NFT component.
- Call the LoadNFT function and pass it your NFT struct to display your fetched NFT's images automatically.
- Customize the prefab to add text/decorations and customize LoadNFT to use your NFT's metadata if you want to populate that text.

```csharp
NFT nft = await contract.ERC721.Get(0);
Prefab_NFT nftPrefabScript = Instantiate(nftPrefab);
nftPrefabScript.LoadNFT(nft);
```

[Events](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/blob/main/Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Scripts/Prefabs/Prefab_Events.cs) - Fetch and manipulate Contract Events with a simple API!

- Get specific events from any contract.
- Get all events from any contract.
- Event listener support with callback actions.
- Optional query filters.

[Reading](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/blob/main/Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Scripts/Prefabs/Prefab_Reading.cs) - Reading from a contract!

- Fetch ERC20 Token(s).
- Fetch ERC721 NFT(s).
- Fetch ERC1155 NFT(s).
- Fetch Marketplace Listing(s).
- Fetch Pack contents.

[Writing](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/blob/main/Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Scripts/Prefabs/Prefab_Writing.cs) - Writing to a contract!

- Mint ERC20 Token(s).
- Mint ERC721 NFT(s).
- Mint ERC1155 NFT(s).
- Buy Marketplace Listing(s).
- Buy a Pack.

[Miscellaneous](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/blob/main/Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Scripts/Prefabs/Prefab_Miscellaneous.cs) - More examples!

- Get (Native) Balance.
- Custom Contract Read/Write Calls.
- Authentication.
- Message Signing.

[Smart Wallet](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/blob/main/Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Scripts/Prefabs/Prefab_SmartWallet.cs)

- Adding admins to your smart wallet.
- Removing admins from your smart wallet.
- Creating session keys to grant temporary/restricted access to additional signers.
